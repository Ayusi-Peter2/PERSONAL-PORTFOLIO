# Personal Portfolio 

This is a straightforward portfolio project that I developed in October 2022 around the end of phase 2 of my bootcamp at Moringa School to show that I understand react. 

## Description

It is a web application that provides details about a person, including their qualifications and experience. Additionally, it features a backend where the administrator may add, remove, and browse a list of all projects.

## Technologies Used
* HTML
* CSS
* Material UI 
* JS
* JSON Server API
* ReactJS

## Setup / Installation Requirements
* JSON server
* Web Browser
* Internet connection

### Installation steps

* You can use the live link or run it locally.

* To run locally, fork and clone the repository to your local machine, then run `npm install` to add dependencies.

* Install `Json server` if you don't already have it, and start the server.

* Run `npm start` and the app will launch on the browser.

### How it works

After a successful launch, the user only sees the front-end page. The admin page won't appear in the Navbar. To access the admin backend, 
add `/admin` after the URL, i.e (http://localhost:3000/admin).

#### Admin Logins

* Username : admin
* Password: admin123

## Known Bugs

I used routes and the useState hook to handle login because this application mostly uses React. I'll come back to this when we get to the backend module.

Because I didn't want to spend additional effort on CSS, the admin component may not be mobile responsive.
